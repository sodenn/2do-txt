      # Figures out the version of playwright that's installed.
      # 1. Because we don't know what version yarn will resolve it to, we have
      #    to use `yarn why` to get the actually installed version.
      # 2. Because we're in a workspace, we need to make sure we get the version
      #    for the root and not any children, hence the `grep`. If not using
      #    workspaces, this can be skipped.
      # 3. jq comes pre-installed in the Ubuntu runner, so we use that to get
      #    the correct version string.
      # 4. Finally, we use sed to extract just the version number (eg; '1.22.0')
      # The result is stored in steps.playwright-version.outputs.version
